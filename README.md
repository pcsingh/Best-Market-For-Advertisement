# Best-Market-For-Advertisement
So the story is like this, We're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of their courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover other domains, like data science, game development, etc. We want to promote our product and we'd like to invest some money in advertisement. This is the analysis of data and finding a best market for the advertisement.
<br/>
<br/>
So our goal in this project is to find out the best markets to advertise our product. For that we are going to use the FreeCodeCamp survey dataset.
