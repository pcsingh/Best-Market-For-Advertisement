# Best-Market-For-Advertisement
So the story is like this, We're working for an e-learning company that offers courses on programming. Most of their courses are on web and mobile development, but we also cover other domains, like data science, game development, etc. They want to promote their product and wants like to invest some money in advertisement. To help them, we have done the analysis of data to find the best market for their advertisement.
<br/>
<br/>
So our goal in this project is to find out the best markets to advertise our product. For that we are going to use the FreeCodeCamp survey dataset.
